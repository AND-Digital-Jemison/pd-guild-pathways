## Semantic HTML

Semantics refers to the study of language _meaning_, 
in frontend development this meaning comes from the HTML tags we use to mark up a document. 

For example, if you saw a `<h1>` tag, you would know that whatever is found between that tag is a main heading. 
If you saw a `<footer>` tag, you would immediately assume that this exists at the bottom of a webpage.

Semantic HTML represents what your content means and how it should be interpreted by the end User.

So why is Semantic HTML so important? 

Computers don't have eyes 👀 - if you've built a webpage using random tags styled to convey meaning, this meaning gets lost. 

For example, if instead of using a `<h1>` tag to indicate a main heading, you instead style a `<p>` tag to be 32px, 
and then use CSS to make it bright red so that it stands out - for a User using a screenreader, this is just a `<p>` tag. It has no other importance.

Using Semantic HTML helps to make your website more accessible, but also benefits your site's SEO.
